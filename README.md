ExileRaceTracker
================

ExileRaceTracker is a simple AutoIt script that will look for your account (or any account you want to follow) and will display some informations during a race like global position, class position,...

I currently don't provide a compiled script so you will have to install [AutoIt](http://www.autoitscript.com/site/autoit/downloads/).

At the first launch, the script will ask wich account you want to follow. If you want to change the account, just edit ExileRaceTracker.ini.

HotKeys
=======
Shift-Alt-p : Set the tooltip's position to your cursor position.

Shift-Alt-x : Exit the script

Shift-Alt-a : Change the followed account
