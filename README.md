ExileRaceTracker
================

ExileRaceTracker is a simple AutoIt script that will look for your account (or any account you want to follow) and will display some informations during a race like global position, class position,...

I currently don't provide a compiled script so you will have to install [AutoIt](http://www.autoitscript.com/site/autoit/downloads/).

At the first launch, the script will ask wich account you want to follow. If you want to change the account, just edit ExileRaceTracker.ini.

You will have to set the game to borderless fullscreen.

HotKeys
=======
Shift-Alt-P : Set the tooltip's position to your cursor position.

Shift-Alt-X : Exit the script

Shift-Alt-A : Change the followed account

Shift-Alt-W : Activate the script for week races. (The script's default is to ignore Week races because of issues when there are two races at the same time)
